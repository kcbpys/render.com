In my final project, I want to make a Chrome Extension to search up stocks by their ticker and get information returned through FastAPI and YFinance. After I get the minimal viable product working, I will tweak the extension a lot to refine the information given by YFinance and also make the extension look better through possible bootstring integration. I am very excited to work on this as it is something I will be able to use after this class ends and allows me to bring together numerous coding languages and techniques learned this semester into one project.
